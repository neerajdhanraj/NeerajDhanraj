# R Packages

## 1. PSF
* Pattern Sequence Based Forecasting (PSF) takes univariate time series data as input and assist to forecast its future values.
* This algorithm forecasts the behavior of time series based on similarity of pattern sequences.
* Initially, clustering is done with the labeling of samples from database.
* The labels associated with samples are then used for forecasting the future behaviour of time series data.

## 2. imputeTestbench
* Provides a test bench for the comparison of missing data imputation methods in uni-variate time series.
* Imputation methods are compared using different error metrics.
* Proposed imputation methods and alternative error metrics can be used.
