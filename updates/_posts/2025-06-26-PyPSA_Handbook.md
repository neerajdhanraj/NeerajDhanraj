## The PyPSA Handbook is coming soon

Iâ€™m happy to share that *The PyPSA Handbook: Integrated Power System Analysis and Renewable Energy Modeling*â€”co-authored with Dr. Carlo Fanaraâ€”is now in production with Elsevier and scheduled for release in 2025. This book is the result of several years of work in the open-source modeling space, aimed at creating something practical, technically sound, and genuinely useful for both new and experienced users of PyPSA.

Weâ€™ve structured the book to guide readers from the basics of PyPSA all the way to more advanced topics such as renewable integration, storage modeling, grid expansion, and system reliability. Itâ€™s packed with real-world examples, reproducible code, and case studies drawn from actual research and applications.

The finalized front cover is now ready, and the official banner is below. A full flyer and promotional materials will be available soon.

Carlo and I have both worked for years at the intersection of modeling, systems thinking, and practical implementationâ€”across India, Europe, and the Middle East. This handbook reflects that combined perspective: clear, code-based, and grounded in solving real challenges in energy planning.

More updates will follow soon, including chapter previews and sample notebooks. For now, weâ€™re looking forward to getting this into the hands of the community.
