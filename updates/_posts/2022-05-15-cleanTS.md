## `cleanTS` - a tool funded by Google Summer of Code (GSoC) - 2021 is now published in Neurocomputing (Elsevier) journal

I am glad to share that our R package `cleanTS` is now accepted for publication in Neurocomputing (Elsevier) journal. This is a recent package joining the league of Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) tools contributed by me and my teams. While working on huge and voluminous time-series datasets, I felt that there is a need to automate the processes of data cleaning, and this led to the concept of `cleanTS`.

This package was funded by Google Summer of Code (GSoC) - 2021, co-mentored by Prof. Andres Feijoo from the University of Vigo, Spain, and programmed in R by Mr. Mayur Kishor Shende from Defense Institute of Advanced Technology, Pune, India. I heartily congratulate both of them for their efforts and valuable open-source contributions in the field of Machine Learning and Data Science. 

The details of `cleanTS` @ `GSoC-2021` are available [here](https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2021/wiki/cleanTS) and [here](https://mayur1009.github.io/cleanTS/).

`cleanTS` package is available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=cleanTS), and it can be accessed through its Shiny app:

{:.note}

The manuscript describing the `cleanTS` package is now accepted for publication in Neurocomputing (Elsevier) journal, and very soon, it will be available online in the open-access format. Till then it can be accessed through its [arXiv copy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.11815).

My team is dedicated to expanding the features of all our AutoML tools ([imputeTestbench](https://www.neerajbokde.in/software/), [ForecastTB](https://www.neerajbokde.in/viggnette/2021-10-16-forecasttb/), [cleanTS](https://www.neerajbokde.in/software/), [GuessCompx](https://www.neerajbokde.in/viggnette/2021-10-17-GuessCompx/)), and new contributors are always welcome to the team. Please feel free to contact me.
