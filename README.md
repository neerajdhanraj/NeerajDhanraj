# Neeraj Dhanraj Bokde

Originally from Nagpur, India, I am currently based in Abu Dhabi, UAE, where I work as a Senior Researcher in the Renewable and Sustainable Energy Research Center at Technology Innovation Institute (TII), UAE.

I was educated and trained in India and Denmark in engineering, data science, renewable energy, and computer science. At the crossroads of these fields, my research interests lie within the general area of theoretical and applied data science, time series analysis view on industrial applications such as in energy modelling, digital twins, artificial intelligence, bioinformatics, statistical software development, visualization techniques, and predictive analysis; and on exploring the scope of the automation of the machine learning and data science methodologies.
