## A visit to Ramtek town (near Nagpur, Maharashtra, India)

Ramtek town is famous for its ancient Gadh (Fort) Temple of Shri Rama, the Hindu god. However, a very few people know about further older (at least 1200 years old) temple situation in the same town. This temple is know as Kapoor Baoli. A miraculous place to visit in Central India.

## Burning Satellite: The Views from Nagpur and other Vidarbha Region
On 2nd April 2022, at around 9 PM, my cousins have witnessed a beautiful burning object scene in the sky in Nagpur and other Vidarbha regions. Later, it came to know that it was a burning satellite, maybe due to the uncontrolled destroying process. Unfortunately, I could not watch this LIVE in the sky but got these videos from my cousins and her colleagues. These compiled videos are in the public domain and courtesy to the corresponding photographer.
