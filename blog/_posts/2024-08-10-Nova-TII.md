## Honored to Receive the Prestigious NOVA Award for Renewable Energy Research

I’m deeply honored to share that I have received the NOVA Award at the Technology Innovation Institute (TII), Abu Dhabi, in recognition of my research contributions in renewable energy planning for the year 2024.

This award highlights the collaborative and forward-thinking environment at TII, where innovation in clean energy systems, optimization models, and strategic planning continues to shape the UAE’s sustainable future. My work has focused on advancing tools and methodologies for integrated energy system modeling, contributing to smarter, more resilient grids and supporting national decarbonization goals.
