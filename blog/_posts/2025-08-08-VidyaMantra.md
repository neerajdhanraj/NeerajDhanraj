## The Light of Knowledge in All of Us

<div style="background-color:#fff8e7; padding:15px; border-radius:8px;">

<p align="center"><b>या देवी सर्वभूतेषु विद्यारूपेण संस्थिता ।</b></p>  
<p align="center"><b>नमस्तस्यै नमस्तस्यै नमस्तस्यै नमो नमः ॥</b></p>  

<p align="center"><b>Ya Devi Sarva Bhuteshu Vidya Rupena Samsthita ।</b></p>  
<p align="center"><b>Namastasyai Namastasyai Namastasyai Namo Namah ॥</b></p>  

<p align="center"><i>This shloka means: <b>O Goddess, who lives in every being as knowledge, I bow to you again and again.</b></i></p>

</div>

I came across this mantra long ago, but it keeps finding its way back into my life. For me, it is a gentle nudge to remember that wisdom is not only in books or lessons; it is already within us, quietly guiding the way.

Whenever I chant it, I feel calm and centered. It is like pressing a small reset button in my mind, reminding me to see the light of knowledge in myself and in others.

If you wish for a pause in the middle of a busy day, this mantra can be that pause.
